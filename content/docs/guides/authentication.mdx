## Authentication

Our API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can generate and manage your API keys from the dashboard.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Example Code

**JavaScript/Node.js**

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/user', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

**Python**

```python
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/user', headers=headers)
data = response.json()
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Store Keys Securely

Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables:

```bash
# .env file (add to .gitignore)
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### Rotate Keys Regularly

We recommend rotating your API keys every 90 days:

1. Generate a new key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Delete the old key after confirming everything works

#### Use Different Keys for Different Environments

Create separate keys for:
- Development
- Staging
- Production

This limits the impact if a key is compromised.

#### Monitor Key Usage

Check your dashboard regularly for:
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Geographic anomalies

### Key Permissions

You can set different permission levels for API keys:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Read | View resources only |
| Write | Create and update resources |
| Delete | Remove resources |
| Admin | Full access including settings |

### Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Generate a new key immediately

### OAuth 2.0 (Coming Soon)

OAuth 2.0 support for third-party integrations will be available soon. This will allow:
- User authorization flows
- Scoped permissions
- Refresh tokens

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

Common causes:
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Key revoked

### 403 Forbidden

Your API key doesn't have permission for this operation. Check key permissions in your dashboard.

### Rate Limiting

If you receive `429 Too Many Requests`, you've exceeded your rate limit. Implement exponential backoff:

```javascript
async function makeRequestWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);

    if (response.status !== 429) {
      return response;
    }

    // Exponential backoff
    await new Promise(resolve =>
      setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, i) * 1000)
    );
  }

  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```
