Our platform provides a comprehensive API and tools to help developers build modern applications quickly and efficiently.

#### How do I get started?

Check out our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### API & Authentication

#### How do I get an API key?

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click "Generate New Key"

See the [Authentication Guide](/docs/guides/authentication) for details.

#### Can I use multiple API keys?

Yes! We recommend creating separate keys for:

This makes key rotation and management easier.

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff to handle this gracefully. See [Best Practices](/docs/guides/best-practices).
