- Separate data from production
- No rate limits
- Test API keys prefixed with `sk_test_`
- Full API functionality
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Authentication

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between API keys and OAuth?">
**API Keys:**
- Best for server-to-server communication
- Simple to implement
- Full account access
- Never expire
- No user interaction required

**OAuth 2.0:**
- Best for user-facing applications
- Delegated user access
- Granular scopes/permissions
- Tokens expire and can be refreshed
- Requires user authorization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I rotate my API keys?">
1. Go to Settings → API Keys in the dashboard
2. Click "Create New API Key" to generate a new key
3. Update your application to use the new key
4. Test to ensure everything works
5. Delete the old API key

<Callout type="warn">
Always test with the new key before deleting the old one to avoid service interruptions.
</Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My API key is not working. What should I check?">
Common issues:
- **Incorrect format**: Ensure you're using `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` in the Authorization header
- **Expired token**: OAuth tokens expire after 1 hour - refresh them
- **Wrong environment**: Sandbox keys don't work in production and vice versa
- **Deleted key**: Check if the key still exists in your dashboard
- **Insufficient permissions**: Verify the key has the required scopes

Example of correct usage:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_abc123...',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple API keys?">
Yes! You can create multiple API keys for different purposes:
- Separate keys for development, staging, and production
- Different keys for different services or applications
- Rotating keys without downtime
- Tracking usage per key

Each key has the same permissions as your account unless you're using OAuth with specific scopes.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Rate Limiting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What are the rate limits?">
Rate limits vary by plan:

| Plan | Per Minute | Per Month |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Free | 100 | 10,000 |
| Pro | 1,000 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

Rate limit information is included in every API response:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your limit
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the limit resets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed the rate limit?">
When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with:
- `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry
- Error message with details

<Callout type="error">
Implement exponential backoff to handle rate limits gracefully. Continued violation may result in temporary IP blocking.
</Callout>

```javascript
if (response.status === 429) {
  const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After');
  await sleep(retryAfter * 1000);
  // Retry request
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request a rate limit increase?">
Yes! Enterprise customers can request custom rate limits. Contact sales@example.com with:
- Your use case
- Expected request volume
- Current limitations you're facing

We'll work with you to find a solution that fits your needs.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Data and Pagination

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do I paginate through large result sets?">
Use the `page` and `per_page` query parameters:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.example.com/v1/users?page=2&per_page=50'
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.pagination);
// { page: 2, per_page: 50, total: 245 }
```

The maximum `per_page` is 100. To fetch all records:

```javascript
async function fetchAll(endpoint) {
  const results = [];
  let page = 1;
  let hasMore = true;

  while (hasMore) {
    const data = await fetch(`${endpoint}?page=${page}&per_page=100`);
    results.push(...data.data);
    hasMore = page * data.pagination.per_page < data.pagination.total;
    page++;
  }

  return results;
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the maximum page size?">
The maximum `per_page` value is 100. Requesting more than 100 items will be automatically capped at 100.

For better performance, we recommend using the default value (20) unless you specifically need more items per request.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I filter and sort results?">
Most list endpoints support filtering and sorting via query parameters:

```javascript
// Filter by status
GET /users?status=active

// Sort by creation date
GET /users?sort=created_at&order=desc

// Combine filters
GET /projects?team_id=team_123&status=active&sort=name
```

Check the specific endpoint documentation for available filters.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Webhooks

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What are webhooks and why should I use them?">
Webhooks allow our platform to notify your application when events occur in real-time, instead of you polling the API.

**Benefits:**
- Real-time notifications
- Reduce API calls
- Lower latency
- Event-driven architecture

**Common use cases:**
- User created/updated
- Payment completed
- Project status changed
- File uploaded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I set up webhooks?">
1. Create an endpoint in your application to receive webhook events
2. Register the webhook URL in the dashboard or via API:

```javascript
const webhook = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: 'https://yourapp.com/webhooks',
    events: ['user.created', 'payment.completed'],
    secret: 'your_webhook_secret'
  })
});
```

3. Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I verify webhook signatures?">
Verify the `X-Webhook-Signature` header to ensure the webhook is from us:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(digest)
  );
}

// In your webhook handler
app.post('/webhooks', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);

  if (!verifyWebhook(payload, signature, process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  // Process webhook event
  handleWebhookEvent(req.body);
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my webhook endpoint is down?">
We implement automatic retry logic:
- Immediate retry on failure
- Exponential backoff (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour)
- Up to 10 retry attempts over 3 days
- Failed webhooks visible in dashboard

<Callout type="warn">
Respond with a `200 OK` status within 10 seconds to acknowledge receipt. Long processing should be done asynchronously.
</Callout>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Errors and Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What do the different error codes mean?">
| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Check request parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify API key/token |
| 403 | Forbidden | Check permissions/scopes |
| 404 | Not Found | Verify resource ID exists |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Implement backoff, wait before retry |
| 500 | Server Error | Retry with exponential backoff |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Temporary outage, retry later |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug API errors?">
1. **Check the error response**: It includes details about what went wrong

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The 'email' parameter is required",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
```

2. **Review request logs**: Check what you're sending

3. **Use curl to isolate issues**: Test with curl to rule out SDK bugs

4. **Check API status**: Visit status.example.com for any incidents

5. **Enable debug logging**: Most SDKs support verbose logging
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting 500 errors. What should I do?">
500-level errors indicate a problem on our end:

1. **Check status page**: Visit status.example.com
2. **Retry with exponential backoff**: The issue may be temporary
3. **Contact support**: If errors persist, reach out with:
   - Request ID from error response
   - Timestamp of the error
   - Endpoint you were calling
   - Request parameters (sanitized)

<Callout type="info">
All API responses include an `X-Request-ID` header. Include this when contacting support for faster troubleshooting.
</Callout>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Common Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="CORS errors in browser">
If you're getting CORS errors when making requests from a browser:

**Cause**: API requests from browser-based applications must comply with CORS policies.

**Solution**:
- Make API calls from your backend instead of the browser
- Configure allowed origins in the dashboard
- Use our client-side SDK which handles CORS properly

<Callout type="warn">
Never expose API keys in browser-based applications. Use OAuth or a backend proxy instead.
</Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate errors">
If you're getting SSL/TLS certificate errors:

**Causes**:
- Outdated SSL certificates on your system
- Corporate proxy intercepting requests
- Using HTTP instead of HTTPS

**Solutions**:
- Update your system's CA certificates
- Configure proxy settings properly
- Ensure you're using `https://` in your API URLs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow API responses">
If API requests are taking too long:

1. **Check your network**: Test with other APIs
2. **Use pagination**: Don't fetch all data at once
3. **Check response times**: Use `X-Response-Time` header
4. **Implement caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
5. **Use webhooks**: Instead of polling for changes

Normal response times:
- Simple queries: < 100ms
- Complex queries: < 500ms
- Batch operations: < 2s
